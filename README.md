# ICS-211-Midterm-Review

This repository contains directories for each of the practice exercises I gave to the students of my ICS 211 Midterm review on 2/19/2021. Each exercise has it's own folder, with programs that work.

Note: Many of these programs may not check for exceptions or follow many coding standards because these were meant to show specific topics. In any big programming assignment that will actually be turned in, please follow coding standards.

Good luck on the midterm!
